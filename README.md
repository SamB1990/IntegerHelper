# What is IntegerHelper

The integer helper was born to help me keep a library of useful extensions to integers. I am constantly writing methods across different projects that i again replicate when i move on to the next one so i thought i should create a library.

## Current Functionality
### Parity
parity methods to detemine odd and even integers and also to turn an integer into an odd or even integer.
Methods include:
  -IsEven
  -ToEven
  -ToOdd
